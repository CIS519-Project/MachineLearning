Extend one class SVM to multi-class SVM
Implmented ROCcurve for multi-class problems

function multiSVMfit:
	input: 
		X: n-by-d matrix includes training data
		Y: n-by-1 vector of labels of training data(could be any type)
	output: 
		cl: a 1-by-k cell includes svm-classifiers for different lables, where k = length(unique(Y))
Please modify this .m file to change the kernel (gaussianKernel or linearKernel). 



function multiSVMpredict:
	input:
		cl: a cell includes several svm-classifiers for different lables
		X: n-by-d matrix includes training data
	outputï¼š 
		pred: predictions given by multi-class svm classifier, n-by-1 matrix
		score: unnormalized prediction score for each class, n-by-k, where score(i,j) indicates the score of instance i being predicted as class j

function plotROC:
	input:
		labels: true labels of instances, n-by-1 vector
		scores: n-by-k matrix,
		cl: cell including the classifiers
		colors: a string colors of the ROC curves for different labels, ex. 'rgb'
